# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Creating a website that scrapes date about mars from multiple different sources and than summarizes the results in an easily sharable format.

## Process

We first scraped data to pull in recent news about mars that we can feed into our news summary. Followed by scraping the web for images that can be used on our website. We stored all the information we captured using Mongo DB and smmarized the results on a website using Flask. As the final step the outpup was formatted in index.html using bootstrap styles to create a more impactful and visual page, which is a the same time responsive to varous device types. 

## Final product

The final website looks like the below images, and can be updated by scraping the newest available information when the sources update.
